# PIC_p18f4580_test
This code was created as a basic functionality check to test the flag bits inside the status register of a PIC p18f4580

This program is meant to be executed in MPLAB X IDE line by line so the status register can be viewed. It is a simple troubleshooting tool to validate the functionality of a PIC p18f4580 but could easily be modified to work with other chips using the same IDE.
